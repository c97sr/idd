An R Package for Infectious Disease Dynamics. This acts mainly as a holding vessel for small projects that then find a home elsewhere. and should enables reproducibility for in progress work.

It also provides utility functions. These are usually overtaken by other packages or R base. 

## Current activity

I'm refining the ongoing_containment.R script in vignettes to compare pandemic scenarios that were discussed prior to 2020 lockdowns with what eventually happened. The comparison is based on cumulative estimated excess mortality from the time of emergence of the virus, using data from the Economist and from Our World In Data. 

I'd also like to find quarterly GDP data for Q2 to Q3 2020 to check the correlation between cumulative excess deaths and changes in GDP over that period.
