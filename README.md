An R Package for Infectious Disease Dynamics. This acts mainly as a holding vessel for small projects that then find homes elsewhere. It should also enables reproducibility for in progress work and utility functions that I use elsewhere.

## Current activity

I'm refining the ongoing_containment.R script in vignettes to compare pandemic scenarios that were discussed prior to 2020 lockdowns with what eventually happened. The comparison is based on cumulative estimated excess mortality from the time of emergence of the virus, using data from the Economist and from Our World In Data. 

I'd also like to find quarterly GDP data for Q2 to Q3 2020 to check the correlation between cumulative excess deaths and changes in GDP over that period.

The main files I'm working in at the moment are:
