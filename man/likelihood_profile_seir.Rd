\title{construct a likelihood profile for R_0 given data}
\usage{
likelihood_profile_seir(
  incidence_data,
  current_week,
  starting_week,
  R_0_min,
  R_0_max
)
}
\arguments{
\item{incidence_data}{incidence data extracted by \code{extract_incidence}}

\item{current_week}{numeric vector of length 1: week number of the current week}

\item{starting_week}{numeric vector of length 1: 
guess for week number when the epidemic started. Use data from starting week
to current week to predict}

\item{R_0_min}{numeric vector of length 1: lower bound of R_0 values over
which to construct likelihood profile}

\item{R_0_max}{numeric vector of length 1: upper bound of R_0 values over
which to construct likelihood profile}
}
\value{
a data frame with the following columns:
R_0_vec: numeric vector of R_0 values which we're scanning over
log_likelihood_vec: log likelihood for those values of R_0
}
\description{
\code{likelihood_profile_seir} calculates the log likelihood of the model 
given the data, for a range of R_0. The other parameters are fixed
